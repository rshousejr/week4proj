# week4proj

This repo contains an R Script and codebook describing an R project that creates a single, tidy data set from the UCI HAR Dataset. This dataset has multiple files of observations of motion data taken from a smartphone. 

The resulting dataset contains mean and standard deviation values only, with descriptive names for each column.
